Homework 2 about Functions: Write a function that receives three parameters: name, weight, and height.
The default value for name is James. The function calculates the BMI. BMI is: weight/(height^2).
Weight should be in kg and height should be in meters. For instance, if the weight is 60 kg and the
height is 1.7 m, then the BMI should be 20.76. The function should return "<name>'s BMI is greater
than or equal to 22" if the BMI is greater than or equal to 22. Otherwise, return "<name>'s BMI is less than 22".
Call the function and print its output.
