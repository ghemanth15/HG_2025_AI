Homework 2 about Integers and Floats: The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers. The first two numbers
are 0 and 1. The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series is 13+21 = 34. Write a program
that receives an integer from the user, called n, and prints out Fibonacci series up to n terms.

Homework 3 about Integers and Floats: Write a program that receives an integer from the user, called n,
and prints the first n prime numbers. For example, if the input is 7, the output should
be: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17.

Homework 5 about Integers and Floats: Write a program that receives an integer n from the user and prints
the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers.
For example, if n=3, the output should be 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14.
