# Homework 1 about Problem Solving:
# Introduction: A magic square is a 2D matrix composed of n^2 integers where n is the length of one row or column.
# In a magic square each row, each column, and the two diagonals must sum to the same value.
# Problem: Given a 2D matrix, your program must determine if the square is magic or not magic. It will print
# "True" or "False" accordingly.
# Input: Your program will first take an input n, representing the length of one row of the matrix from the user.
# It will then take n lines of input containing n integers separated by spaces from the user.
