## Python Basics – Prerequisite for AI and Machine Learning

### Folder: src

The src folder contains 13 Python files that together cover the essential programming fundamentals required as a foundation for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
Each file focuses on a key Python concept such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, classes and file handling.
These files are structured to help you build a strong understanding of Python through short, clear examples that can be easily practiced and modified.


### Importance of Python for AI/ML

Python is the primary language used in AI and ML due to its simplicity, readability and extensive ecosystem of powerful libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Having a solid grasp of Python fundamentals enables you to:
	•	Write efficient and well structured machine learning code
	•	Understand and implement core algorithms from scratch
	•	Work confidently with data structures and perform data preprocessing
	•	Debug, test and optimize AI/ML workflows effectively

Before working on complex AI models, it is essential to be comfortable with the logic and syntax of Python.
A strong foundation ensures that your focus remains on the mathematical and conceptual aspects of AI/ML rather than on programming hurdles.

### Solutions and Practice Approach

Each exercise in the src folder is accompanied by a solution file.
However, it is not recommended to view the solutions immediately.

First, attempt the exercises on your own to develop problem solving skills and confidence.
Use the provided solutions only for verification or guidance if you get stuck.

This approach encourages hands on learning and prepares you to think algorithmically, a key skill in developing AI and ML models.
